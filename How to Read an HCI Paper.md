# How to Read an HCI Paper 

## 1. Three-Pass Approach

### 1.1 Objective of The Three Pass

* The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. 

* The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details.
* The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

### 1.2 The First Pass

The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. 

This pass will take about five to ten minutes for you to decide whether you need to do any more passes. 

To finish the first pass, you need to follow these steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction 
2. Read the section and sub-section headings
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs: 

1. **Category**: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype? 
2. **Context**: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem? 
3. **Correctness**: Do the assumptions appear to be valid? 
4. **Contributions**: What are the paper’s main contributions? 
5. **Clarity**: Is the paper well written?

If the paper doesn’t interest you, or you don’t know enough about the area to understand the paper, or that the authors make invalid assumptions, you can save your future pass.

### 1.3 The Second Pass

The second pass requires you to read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. 

In the second pass, you may use these tips:

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams, and other illustrations in the paper. If there are common mistakes in the graphs, you can save your time for the truly excellent paper. 
2.  Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading. This is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper.

The second pass should take up to an hour. After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. 

This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested but does not lie in your research specialty

Sometimes you won’t understand a paper even at the end of the second pass. You can now choose to (a) set the paper aside, hoping you don’t need to understand the material to be successful in your career, (b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material, or (c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

### 1.4 The Third Pass

The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

This pass requires great attention to detail. You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader. 

At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

In this section, we know how to follow the step-by-step instructions to read a research paper and grasp the content. This method could be applied to the second pass in the "Three-Pass Approach".

**1) Begin by reading the introduction, not the abstract.**

The abstract is that dense first paragraph at the very beginning of a paper. It contains a succinct summary of the entire paper. You may inadvertently become biased by the authors’ interpretation of the results. 

The more unfamiliar you are with the paper/field, the longer you need to spend in the intro. Authors tend to do a good job consolidating background info and providing copious amounts of references. This section is usually the easiest to read like a textbook. Take notes of other references and background info you don’t know or want to examine further.

**2) Identify the Big question.**

Focusing on the big question helps you focus on why this research is being done. Try to answer “What problem is this entire field trying to solve?”.

**3) Summarize the background in five sentences or less.**

You need to be able to succinctly explain why this research has been done to understand it. Be sure to mention: The work has been done before for this big question and its limitations and the work needs to be done next.

**4) Identify the Specific question(s).**

Identify one or more hypotheses being tested. Answer the exact question that the authors are trying to answer with their research, and write them down.

**5) Identify the approach.**

**6) Read the methods section.**

Draw a diagram for each experiment, showing exactly what the authors did. Include as much detail as you need to fully understand the work.

**7) Read the results section.**

Write one or more paragraphs to summarize the results for each experiment, each figure, and each table. Don’t yet try to decide what the results *mean*; just write down what they *are*.

Pay careful attention to figures and tables! 

- The words “significant” and “non-significant.” These have precise statistical meanings. 

* Graphs. Do they have error bars on them? For certain types of studies, a lack of confidence intervals is a major red flag.

* The sample size. For some research purposes, a sample size of 10 is sufficient, but for most studies, larger is better.

**8) Determine whether the results answer the specific question(s).**

You need to first have thought about what the result means, and then read the authors' interpretation. It's OK to change your mind, but it is still a good habit to start practicing forming your own interpretations.

**9) Read the conclusion/discussion/interpretation section.**

In this part, you need to decide whether you agree with the authors in their interpretation section. Pay attention to their identification of weaknesses and the next step and give your own idea.

**10) Go back to the beginning and read the abstract.**

After you have read the whole paper and understand the result interpretation, you can go back to the beginning and read the abstract. You can see whether the abstract matches with the paper and with your interpretation of the paper.

**11) Find out what other researchers say about the paper.**

If possible, you can use Google to find whether there are any experts in this field sharing their criticism of the study. Do this step last so that you are better prepared to think critically about what other people say. 

## 3. Practical Tips for Reading a Paper

Do plan to spend anywhere from **3–6 hours** to really digest a paper, remember they are *very* dense! Try to find a quiet place and grab your favorite beverage. You may also need to set some alarms to make sure you take a break every once a while. If you feel tired to think about the paper, get up for a walk, and refresh your mind.
