# How to Write a Research Proposal

## Goal of a Research Proposal

1. To present and justify the need to study a research problem

Research proposals contain extensive literature reviews. They must provide persuasive evidence that a need exists for the proposed study.

2. To present the practical ways in which the proposed study should be conducted

A proposal describes detailed methodology for conducting the research consistent with requirements of the professional or academic field and a statement on anticipated outcomes and/or benefits derived from the study's completion.

## Features of a Research Proposal 

There are four main features for a research proposal. **First**, a well-organized research proposal can give the researchers themselves a clear big picture of the whole research projects. Researchers include all the essential issues and all the necessary work in the context, so as to understand the projects from a general aspect. **Second**, a clear research proposal can serve as a great progress monitor. Normally, one professor supervised several graduate students and may not remember the detailed progress of each students. With a clear research proposal, the supervisor could easily know the current status and positions to the project. Therefore, supervisor could provide suitable feedback in the discussion. **Third**, besides of providing information to the researchers themselves and the supervisors, research proposals can also use as a potential publication to the other researchers in the field. Through providing sufficient background information, other interested researchers can understand the project, and they may contact to discuss or collaborate. **Fourth**, research can be quite exciting, and it is easy to get off topic. A research plan can keep everyone related to the project and every step on track and make sure the overarching goals are well-defined and will get answered by the research. 

## Content and Structures

#### Title

#### Introduction

After reading the introduction, the readers should not only have an understanding of what you want to do, but they should also be able to gain a sense of your passion for the topic and to be excited about the study's possible outcomes. Note that most proposals do not include an abstract [summary] before the introduction.

A introduction should be a narrative written in two to four paragraphs that succinctly answers the following four questions:

1. What is the central research problem?
2. What is the topic of study related to that research problem?
3. What methods should be used to analyze the research problem?
4. Why is this important research, what is its significance, and why should someone reading the proposal care about the outcomes of the proposed study?

#### Background

This is where you explain the context of your proposal and describe in detail why it's important. Approach writing this section with the thought that you can’t assume your readers will know as much about the research problem as you do.

Note that this section is not an essay going over everything you have learned about the topic; instead, you must choose what is most relevant in explaining the aims of your research.

To establish the significance of your proposed study, you probably would like to :

* State the research problem and give a more detailed explanation about the purpose of the study than what you stated in the introduction. This is particularly important if the problem is complex or multifaceted.
* Present the rationale of your proposed study and clearly indicate why it is worth doing.

#### Literature Review

The purpose here is to place your project within the larger whole of what is currently being explored, while demonstrating to your readers that your work is original and innovative.

**To help frame your proposal's review of prior research, consider the "five C’s" of writing a literature review:**

1. **Cite**, so as to keep the primary focus on the literature pertinent to your research problem.
2. **Compare** the various arguments, theories, methodologies, and findings expressed in the literature: what do the authors agree on? Who applies similar approaches to analyzing the research problem?
3. **Contrast** the various arguments, themes, methodologies, approaches, and controversies expressed in the literature: describe what are the major areas of disagreement, controversy, or debate among scholars?
4. **Critique** the literature: Which arguments are more persuasive, and why? Which approaches, findings, and methodologies seem most reliable, valid, or appropriate, and why? Pay attention to the verbs you use to describe what an author says/does [ e.g. , asserts, demonstrates, argues, etc.].
5. **Connect** the literature to your own area of research and investigation: how does your own work draw upon, depart from, synthesize, or add a new perspective to what has been said in the literature?

#### Research Methods

This section must be well-written and logically organized because you are not actually doing the research, yet, your reader must have confidence that it is worth pursuing. Describe the overall research design by building upon and drawing examples from your review of the literature.

**When describing the methods you will use, be sure to cover the following:**

- Specify the research process you will undertake and the way you will interpret the results obtained in relation to the research problem. 
- Keep in mind that the methodology is not just a list of tasks; it is an argument as to why these tasks add up to the best way to investigate the research problem. This is an important point because the mere listing of tasks to be performed does not demonstrate that, collectively, they effectively address the research problem. 
- Anticipate and acknowledge any potential barriers and pitfalls in carrying out your research design and explain how you plan to address them. No method is perfect so you need to describe where you believe challenges may exist in obtaining data or accessing information.

## To Do & Not To Do

### To Do

* Keep the research proposal updated. A research proposal should not be static. As the researchers' thoughts change with the work, the research plan need to be updated.
* Keep a record of the history. It is good to keep all the history versions of the research proposal. Especially for long project, researchers need to remember how the process was shaped, what the original point of departure was and their inspiring ideas for future research.
* Pay attention to the quality of writing. A research proposal should be effective in delivering the idea. Therefore, it is important that your proposal is coherent, clear, and compelling.
* Cite the landmark works in the literature review. A proposal need to be grounded in the foundational research and understanding the development and scope of the issue.
* Develop a coherent and persuasive argument. In many workplace settings, the research proposal is intended to argue for why a study should be funded.

### Not To Do

* Be "all over the map" or diverge into on unrelated tangents. A research proposal must be focused with a clear sense of purpose
* Too much detail on minor issues. A proposal should focus on only a few key research questions in order to support the argument. Minor issues, even if valid, can be mentioned but they should not dominate the overall narrative.
